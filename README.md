This is a basic version of the grep cli utility in Unix platforms.
I used it to learn more about scoped threads in Rust and how to create CLI apps with the Clap Rust library. 
It accepts two parameters: 
1. -f for file input
2. -s for search phrase.
It prints out lines in the file containing that search phrase.
